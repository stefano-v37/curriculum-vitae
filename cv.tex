  \ecvsection{Skills}
  
  \ecvblueitem{Technical skills from education}{
  % During my trainee I have been having the opportunity to improve one of my interest which is
  % that of coding. I have been daily writing procedural instruction using Python under Jupyter environment,
  % and developing functional and object oriented programming features on repositories
  % under GIT on Atlassian Bitbucket. I am having the luck to collaborate with software architects
  % that are deploying on AWS the \emph{Berth and anchorage identification} logic I have written and therefore
  % observing their high-level methodologies. Also, I have acquired some experience in the maritime industry, in particular on the field of the
  % power supply and distribution.
  	
  The main topic of my Universitary studies is that of sizing energy conversion plant; in particular, the main technologies considered were steam and turbogas turbines, reciprocating internal combustion engines and heat recovery.
  Considerable attention was adressed to renewable energy sources and their specific implementations and requirements (ORC, storage systems).
  }
  %During those 5 years I have made several projects using (mainly) MATLAB, EES,
  %ModeFRONTIER, ANSYS CFX, ANSYS Fluent and SolidWorks. Each of these
  %projects required a report of the results and therefore I have some experience with the markups
  %of \LaTeX{} and TiKz.}
  \ecvblueitem{Technical skills from working experiences}{The typical task during my trainee was that of fetching historic data from vessels in order to find patterns in routes and operations
  so that it was possible to design the best engine room arrangement and run the simulations against the current configuration and competitor ones.
  %This \texttt{data driven design} flow allowed me to learn \texttt{python} programming.
  During this year I could improve my knowledge on the energy conversion on board of vessels and in particular I had the opportunity to gain a good knowledge of Wärtsilä portfolio.
  
  In the successive scholarship I could dig deeper into the knowledge of Wärtsilä products by seeing some of the mechanical processes behind various components.
  }

  \ecvitem{Programming}{\texttt{python 3}, \texttt{java}, \texttt{git} (bitbucket, gitlab, github, lfs), databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite), \texttt{UDP} and \texttt{TCP/IP}, \texttt{REST API}.
    }

  \ecvitem{System integration}{KUKA Sunrise environment, Beckhoff EtherCAT, MQTT, PLC programming (FBD and LAD), Siemens TIA Portal, safety standards. Wiring of PLC based systems (digital IOs, power supply, relays, electrovalves, DC motors).
  }
  \ecvitem{Mechanical design}{Siemens NX}
  
  \ecvblueitem{Soft skills}{
  I am creative and curious, I like to learn new things and I appreciate being in a technologically
  driven context where expanding the knowledge is a shared target, therefore I am happy to work in a stimulating team where I am keen to listen and share my opinions.
  
  I enjoy relating with colleagues and customers in a friendly manner, and at the same time I am improving on negotiation and conveying messages.

  I am optimistic but at the same time realistic, recognizing where there is a limit and committing
  to reach it.  
  
  I love sport, in particular basketball and racing. I would say that playing basketball during high school has contributed to make me an hard
  worker who strives to achieve results.}
